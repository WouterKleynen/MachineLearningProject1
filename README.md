# MachineLearningProject1
Repository voor alle code van het eerste project van Machine Learning


How to setup your Project:
- Download the latest Python version via: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Make sure you remove other conflicting Python versions from your PC if possible to avoid problems
- Download an IDE for Github, I'd recommend Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
- Go to our project repository page on Github.com: https://github.com/WouterKleynen/MachineLearningProject1
- Click on the green buttont that says "Code", then click on "Open with Github Desktop"
- Follow the steps to store your local version of the project and make sure you remember where your local project folder is being stored
- Open your command prompt and navigate to your local project directory via "cd /path/to/your/directory/folder"
- To create your local Virtual Environment, type in the command prompt: "python -m venv venv"
- To activate the Virtual Enviroment, type in the command prompt: "venv\Scripts\activate"
- To install all necessary libraries, type in the command prompt: "pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt"
- Download an IDE to develop code, like Pycharm of Visual Studio code, doesn't really matter which one.
- When you want to run code make sure the Python Interpreter of your created Virtual Environment is selected. If you have to select it manually it can be found at /path/to/your/directory/folder/venv/Scripts/python.exe
- That should be it
